\indent Automated recognition of mathematical notation is a challenging pattern recognition problem of great recognition of mathematical notation is a practical importance. Applications include the conversion of scientific papers from printed to electronic form and the reading of scientific documents to visually impaired users. Recognition of handwritten expressions permits users to write mathematical expressions on a data tablet; this is a convenient alternative to input methods such as typing LATEX expressions or using a structure-based editor for mathematical notation.\\
